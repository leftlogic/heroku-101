# Node + Heroku 101

This guide will walk you through building your first Node web server, and deploying it to the world with Heroku.

The guide assumes you have some familiarity with (and access to) a terminal.

## Install Node + npm

The first step is to make sure you've got Node and npm installed. To do so, head to [the Node website](http://nodejs.org/) and follow their instructions.

`npm` is a tool for managing packages and modules published by other members of the Node community. In most cases, it'll come bundled with your Node install.

To test that both are working, open up your terminal and type:

```bash
$ node -v
v0.x.x
```

You should see some kind of version number come back (mine was `v0.10.13`). If you don't, Google the error you get or ask someone.

To test `npm`, type the following:

```bash
$ npm -v
0.x.x
```

Again, you should get a version number (mine was `1.3.2`). Google or ask about any errors.
